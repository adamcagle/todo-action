# TODO: Try Removing Markdown
#  Markdown sort of works, but it seems that the body is sometimes truncated prematurely. I'm not sure what causes this.
# 
#  I can link to prior issues such as 1
# 
#  I can add a hyperlink https://www.google.com
# 
#  I can add a list
#    Item 1
#    Item 2
#    Item 3
#
#  Heading Level 2
#  These seem to throw things off
# 
#  Another Heading
#  Another List:
#    Item 1
#    Item 2
#  And assignees doesn't seem to get picked up.
#  assignees: adamcagle
hello_world <- function() {
print("Hello World!")
}
